# Timesuck 

Are you spending too much time on the computer? Find out with Timesuck. Timesuck logs your computer activity for easy analysis.

# Aren't there better solutions available?

Almost all existing solutions send data back to an external website (I'm looking at you RescueTime).

# Where are the pretty graphs?

Nowhere. Timesuck is only aimed at data collection. [timesuck-tools](https://www.github.com/derferman/timesuck-tools) provides a Python interface for analyzing log data. Check it out.
